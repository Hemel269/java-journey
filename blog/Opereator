operator is someting in coding help to operate things  // its a copy past

1. Arithmatic operator

+
-
/
*      // this all are no need to explain
% : modulas // this is baghsesh in my language 
** : exponentiotion // its give power like math

this is called unary operator

++ : increment // its mean if i write a++ means a=a+1
-- : decrement // its mean if i write a-- means a=a-1


2. Assignment operator:
to assign some value

=     //   its mean assigning value ,value is assign by right to left
+=    //   if a=5 and i enter a+=4 than it will add 5 and 4 and output will be 9
-=    //    same logic 5-4 output will be 1
/=     //   it will be 1.25
*=     //   it will be 20 
%=      //   it will be 1

this is how it all work it feel easy to me thats why i did't show any code



3. Comparisn operator:
its for comparison, its return true and false

1. == // equal
2. === // equal but very strict its detect the number and string
3. != // not equal
4. !== // strict not equal
5. > // greater
6. < // less
7. >= // greater or equal
8. <= // less or equal


4. Logical operator:
comparison but twist here

1. && : logical and //it use for two condition if both condition return true than it will say true, otherwise it give false
2.|| : logical or // if any condition true , it will return true
3.! : logical not // it will make true return false and false return true
