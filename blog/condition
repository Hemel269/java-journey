#Conditional statement;
so condition is becically when you do something by your program using condition

#there is somekind of condition ;
1. if 
2. if else
3. else if
4. switch 
5. ternary

**lets see how they work and how i use them

1. if statement:
  so when you have to do a condition than use if statement.
#syntex:

if (condition){
  console.log(what you wanna print)
}

so if your if condition return something ture than console.log will be print otherwise it will not print

^^ here is some example

let age = 27                          //age is a variable and its value is 27

if(age=>18){                         // here i give condition if age greter or equal to 18
    console.log("you can vote")     // condition is true now it will print
}
output;
you can vote

2.if else statement:
  so its be like another if statement but twist is now if it don't give true result you can print false result.
#syntex;
if (condition){
  console.log(if true;what you wanna print)
} esle {
  console.log(if false;what you wanna print)
}

^^ here is example
let age =15                         //age is a variable and its value is 15

if(age>=18){                          // here i give condition if age greter or equal to 18
    console.log("you can vote")       // if true than print this
} else{
    console.log("you cant vote")        // if false print this
}
output;
you cant vote

3.if ,else if , else statement:
  so when you have many condition than use it 
syntex;
if (condition1) {
  // code if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // code if condition2 is true
} else {
  // code if none of the conditions are true
}
-you can add more condition on it
