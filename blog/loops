# Loop
loop is the way to do task repeatly like if you wanna print something you will do console.log(what you wanna print)
but when you have to do this in very large number than here is work loop

^^ there is some kind of loops but for me according to 80/20 rule i am not covering all

1. for loop
2.while loop
3. do while loop

now i am going to explain it ,how it work, when to use, and how to use 
there you will find syntex and my solved question and lastly one or two project using loop
so lets begin

1. FOR LOOP
  syntex
for (initializaion,stop condition,update condition)
this is the way to declare a for loop

so if you wanna do print 1 to 100 ;
^^^
for (let i= 1; i<=100; i++){ 
    console.log(i)
}

so in there i= 1 jsut declare the value of i 
than stop condition like if i equal or less than 100 than always i++(i=i+1)
this is how it will print 1 to 100;

in console.log() i put my name or something string than it will print it 100 times;
##special note ; if the stoping condition not declare properly than loop will be go infinite time so make sure this

2.WHILE LOOP;
syntex;

while (condition){
  work
  upgrade
}
you can see in while loop condition is on top and lastly there is updation..
and good way is declare variable before start the loop

example;
let a=1                     // declare the value
while(a<=10){               // the stoping condition
    console.log(a)
    a++                     // there is updation
}
in here firstly declare the variable 
and give this a condition if a less than or qual to 10 than it will run
and a++(a=a+1) this is update condition
in here you can assign any value to a

#### special note; every loop work like this it will check the stop condition than the updation ,if stop condition return false than it will stop


3.DO WHILE LOOP
syntex
let = assign your value
do{
  do work
  updatetion
} while (condition)

in this case the stoping condition will check last thats why it will run atleast once
example;
