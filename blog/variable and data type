#Variable = its a box where you can contain any value
example:
let a =5
let b = "hemel"
in there a and v are variable where i put value 5 and "hemel"
^^rules of variable
1. use letter,number,underscore,doller$ sign are allowed
2.can't use reserbed word
3.they are very case sensetive like A and a is different variable

**importatnt:
before declare variable you have to add let,const or var
let is suggested
before declare use let like let a= 3

why you don't use const and var:
you cant change the value of const
and var are global its don't care about block
but let care about your block thats why you must use let before variable;



## Data type:
1.premitive 2.object

here is 7 type of premitive data type;
1. Number; its a number
2. String: is "" are there its a string
3. boolean: its ture and false
4.undefined : when value is not defined
5. Null : its mean nothing
6. symbol : its symbol dumb
7.Bigint: i don't have time to learn this

** you can see the type of variable just write console.log(typeof variable

2.Object:
for object i will make another folder but lets gain some knowladge about it  now

so obj is a variable where you can put multiple value
you are smart enough to get this thats why i am just put the chatgpt code for it
here is it

const person = {
  name: "Najim",
  age: 20,
  isStudent: true
};

its just idea of obj i will add separete file for obj next lesson

this is the end hold you breate till the end
